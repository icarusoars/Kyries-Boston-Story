# Kyries-Boston-Story
A Data Analysis of Kyrie's Journey @ Boston

Kyrie Irving. The magician. The best ball-handler of all time. The player with an infinite rabits to pull out of his hat under the basket. He's a great player no doubt.

But as a Boston Celtics fan, I absolutely detest him. His personality flaws and lack of understanding in team play brought down a star-stacked Celtics team in 2018 - 2019. He created one of the biggest "what ifs" in Celtics history.

Let's do a Data Analysis of what went wrong with Kyrie and the Celtics.


## Scraping Data
I used selenium + chromedriver to scrape data from NBA stats. Beautifulsoup itself was not enough because a lot of NBA stats data tables are dynamically rendered with Javascript.

Referred to these articles to scrape:
